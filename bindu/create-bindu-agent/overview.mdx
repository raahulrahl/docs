Create Bindu Agent is a cookiecutter template that scaffolds production-ready AI agents in 2 minutes. No boilerplate, no configuration hell, just answer a few questions and get a fully deployable agent that speaks A2A, AP2, and X402 protocols.

## What It Does

Transforms this:
```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/getbindu/create-bindu-agent.git
```

Into a complete agent project with:
- **Protocol Support** - A2A, AP2, and X402 built-in
- **Authentication** - Auth0, DID, and PKI ready
- **Observability** - Phoenix, Langfuse, and Jaeger integration
- **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions workflows
- **Testing** - pytest with coverage
- **Documentation** - MkDocs setup
- **Containerization** - Docker/Podman ready
- **Code Quality** - Ruff, ty, and pre-commit hooks

## Project Structure

After running cookiecutter, you get:

```
your-agent/
├── agent_config.json          # Agent configuration with A2A/AP2/X402 settings
├── your_agent/
│   ├── main.py               # Agent entry point (Bindu-fied!)
│   └── __init__.py
├── skills/                   # Template for adding agent skills
├── tests/                    # Pre-configured pytest tests
├── pyproject.toml            # Dependencies managed by uv
├── Dockerfile                # Ready for containerization
├── .github/workflows/        # CI/CD pipelines
└── README.md                 # Complete setup instructions
```
