title: 'Create a Bindu Agent'
---

Your AI agent, production-ready in 120 seconds. Create Bindu Agent scaffolds intelligent agents that natively communicate in the Internet of Agents.

## Quickstart - Cookiecutter Style

Time to first agent: **~2 minutes** ⏱️

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your agent project and run:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/Saptha-me/create-bindu-agent.git
```

<Note>
Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. If not, install it with:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
</Note>

<Note>
For detailed documentation, see the [Template Overview](/bindu/create-bindu-agent/overview).

## Already Have an Agent? - Manual Setup

If you have an existing agent and want to add Bindu capabilities, you'll need two things: a configuration file and the `bindufy` wrapper.

### Step 1: Create `agent_config.json`

```json
{
  "author": "your.email@example.com",
  "name": "my_existing_agent",
  "description": "My agent with Bindu superpowers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "deployment": {
    "url": "http://localhost:8030",
    "expose": true
  }
}
```

<Note>
See the [Configuration Reference](/bindu/create-bindu-agent/configuration) for all available options including A2A, AP2, and X402 protocol settings.
</Note>

### Step 2: Wrap Your Agent with `bindufy`

```python
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
import json

# Load your config
with open("agent_config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Your existing agent
my_agent = Agent(
    instructions="Your agent instructions",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
)

# Handler function
def agent_handler(messages: list[dict[str, str]]):
    result = my_agent.run(input=messages)
    return result

# Bindufy it!
bindufy(my_agent, config, agent_handler)
```

That's it! Your agent is now live and ready to communicate with other agents in the Internet of Agents.

<Tip>
Check out [examples](https://github.com/Saptha-me/Bindu/tree/main/examples) for different agent frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and more.
</Tip>

## What Happens Next?

You'll be prompted for:
- **Project details** - Name, description, author info
- **Agent framework** - Agno, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.
- **Features** - Authentication, DID, observability, CI/CD
- **License type** - MIT, Apache, BSD, GPL, ISC

Then boom! 💥 Your agent project is ready with:

```
your-agent/
├── agent_config.json          # Agent configuration with A2A/AP2/X402 settings
├── your_agent/
│   ├── main.py               # Agent entry point (Bindu-fied!)
│   └── __init__.py
├── skills/                   # Template for adding agent skills
├── tests/                    # Pre-configured pytest tests
├── pyproject.toml            # Dependencies managed by uv
├── Dockerfile                # Ready for containerization
├── .github/workflows/        # CI/CD pipelines
└── README.md                 # Complete setup instructions
```

## Running Your Agent

Navigate to your agent directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-agent
uv sync
```

Start your agent server:

```bash
uv run python -m your_agent.main
```

Your agent is now live at `http://localhost:3773` and ready to communicate using:
- **A2A** - Agent-to-Agent protocol
- **AP2** - Agentic Protocol 2
- **X402** - Payment rails
