title: 'Create a Bindu Agent'
---

From zero to production-ready agent in 2 minutes. Create Bindu Agent is the fastest way to build AI agents that speak the language of the Internet of Agents.

## Quickstart

Time to first agent: **~2 minutes** ⏱️

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your agent project and run:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/Saptha-me/create-bindu-agent.git
```

<Note>
Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. If not, install it with:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
</Note>

## What Happens Next?

You'll be prompted for:
- **Project details** - Name, description, author info
- **Agent framework** - Agno, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.
- **Features** - Authentication, DID, observability, CI/CD
- **License type** - MIT, Apache, BSD, GPL, ISC

Then boom! 💥 Your agent project is ready with:

```
your-agent/
├── agent_config.json          # Agent configuration with A2A/AP2/X402 settings
├── your_agent/
│   ├── main.py               # Agent entry point (Bindu-fied!)
│   └── __init__.py
├── skills/                   # Template for adding agent skills
├── tests/                    # Pre-configured pytest tests
├── pyproject.toml            # Dependencies managed by uv
├── Dockerfile                # Ready for containerization
├── .github/workflows/        # CI/CD pipelines
└── README.md                 # Complete setup instructions
```

## Running Your Agent

Navigate to your agent directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd your-agent
uv sync
```

Start your agent server:

```bash
uv run python -m your_agent.main
```

Your agent is now live at `http://localhost:3773` and ready to communicate using:
- **A2A** - Agent-to-Agent protocol
- **AP2** - Agentic Protocol 2
- **X402** - Payment rails
