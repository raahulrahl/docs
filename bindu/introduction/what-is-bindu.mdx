> "Every dot connects."

Turn any agent into a live server in seconds.

Bindu takes care of the software engineering and ops so your agent can think, plan, and act in the real world with DID identity, A2A/AP2-compatible I/O, observability & tracing, auth, payments (X402), distributed scheduling, context and  memory etc built in.

You write the prompt. **Bindu makes it fly.**

## See It In Action

Here's a complete example—from agent definition to live server:

```python
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Define your agent
agent = Agent(
    instructions="You are a research assistant that finds and summarizes information.",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]
)

# Configuration
config = {
    "author": "your.email@example.com",
    "name": "research_agent",
    "description": "A research assistant agent",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "capabilities": {},
    "auth": {"enabled": False},
    "storage": {"type": "memory"},
    "scheduler": {"type": "memory"},
    "deployment": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8030",
        "expose": True
    }
}

# Handler function
def handler(messages: list[dict[str, str]]):
    result = agent.run(input=messages)
    return result

# Bindu-fy it
bindufy(agent, config, handler)

# Your agent is now live at http://localhost:8030 with:
# ✅ A2A/AP2 protocol compliance
# ✅ DID authentication
# ✅ Observability & tracing
# ✅ Payment support (X402)
# ✅ Production-ready infrastructure
```

**That's it.** No infrastructure setup. No protocol implementation. No DevOps complexity.

Your agent is now a discoverable, connectable node in the Internet of Agents.

## The 1-Minute Pitch

We've evolved from monoliths to microservices. Now, with LLMs, software can **think, plan, and implement**. But connecting intelligent agents still requires weeks of glue work.

**Bindu solves this.**

We built a lightweight wrapper that transforms any agent into an **A2A/AP2/X402-compliant server** in seconds. No protocol implementation. No DevOps complexity. Just add `bindufy()` to your agent code.

Your agent instantly gets: DID, authentication, observability, payments, scheduling, and memory ready to join the **Internet of Agents**.

Think microservices, but for AI Agents. **Bindu is the dot that connects them all.**
