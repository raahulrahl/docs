title: 'Join the Internet of Agents'
---

Remember that developer who spent three weeks on infrastructure?

Let's make sure that's not you.

In the next **2 minutes**, you'll have a production-ready agent.  
Not a demo. Not a prototype.  
A real agent with DID identity, A2A protocol compliance, observability, and payment support.

Ready to communicate in the Internet of Agents.

Let's go.

## The Fast Way - Cookiecutter Style

Time to first agent: **~2 minutes** ⏱️

This is the fastest way to get started.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your agent project and run:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/getbindu/create-bindu-agent.git
```

<Note>
Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. If not, install it with:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
</Note>

<Note>
For detailed documentation, see the [Template Overview](/bindu/create-bindu-agent/overview).
</Note>

## Already Built Something?

You've got an agent running.  
Maybe it's in LangChain. Maybe CrewAI. Maybe custom code.

Doesn't matter.

You can Bindu-fy it in **5 minutes**.

Two things you need: a config file and the `bindufy` wrapper.  
That's it.

### Step 1: Create `agent_config.json`

```json
{
  "author": "your.email@example.com",
  "name": "my_existing_agent",
  "description": "My agent with Bindu superpowers",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "deployment": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3773",
    "expose": true
  }
}
```

<Note>
See the [Configuration Reference](/bindu/create-bindu-agent/configuration) for all available options including A2A, AP2, and X402 protocol settings.
</Note>

### Step 2: Wrap Your Agent with `bindufy`

```python
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
import json

# Load your config
with open("agent_config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Your existing agent
my_agent = Agent(
    instructions="Your agent instructions",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
)

# Handler function
def agent_handler(messages: list[dict[str, str]]):
    result = my_agent.run(input=messages)
    return result

# Bindufy it!
bindufy(my_agent, config, agent_handler)
```

**Done.**

Your agent is now live.  
Ready to communicate with other agents in the Internet of Agents.

No infrastructure setup.  
No protocol implementation.  
No weeks of DevOps work.

Just your agent, now accessible to the world.

<Tip>
Check out [examples](https://github.com/getbindu/Bindu/tree/main/examples) for different agent frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and more.

## What Happens During Setup?

When you run the cookiecutter command, you'll be prompted for:
- **Project details** - Name, description, author info
- **Agent framework** - Agno, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.
- **Features** - Authentication, DID, observability, CI/CD
- **License type** - MIT, Apache, BSD, GPL, ISC

Then boom! 💥 Your agent project is ready with:

```
your-agent/
├── agent_config.json          # Agent configuration with A2A/AP2/X402 settings
├── your_agent/
│   ├── main.py               # Agent entry point (Bindu-fied!)
│   └── __init__.py
├── skills/                   # Template for adding agent skills
├── tests/                    # Pre-configured pytest tests
├── pyproject.toml            # Dependencies managed by uv
├── Dockerfile                # Ready for containerization
├── .github/workflows/        # CI/CD pipelines
└── README.md                 # Complete setup instructions
```

## Fire It Up

Navigate to your agent directory:

```bash
cd your-agent
```

Install dependencies (this is fast with uv):

```bash
uv sync
```

Start your agent:

```bash
uv run python -m your_agent.main
```

**That's it.**

Your agent is now live at `http://localhost:3773`.

It's speaking:
- **A2A** - Agent-to-Agent protocol
- **AP2** - Agentic Protocol 2
- **X402** - Payment rails

Other agents can discover it.  
Talk to it.  
Pay it for services.

You just joined the Internet of Agents.

## When Things Go Wrong

They usually don't. But if they do:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="uv not found">
    You need uv installed first.
    
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
    
    Then restart your terminal and try again.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Port already in use">
    Something's already running on port 3773.
    
    Change the `deployment_port` in your `agent_config.json` to something else (like 3773 or 9000).
    
    Or kill whatever's using that port.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication errors">
    You probably haven't set up Auth0 credentials yet.
    
    Check the generated README for details on environment variables.
    
    Or disable auth in your config if you're just testing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Dependencies not installing">
    Sometimes the virtual environment gets corrupted.
    
    Nuke it and start fresh:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .venv
    uv sync
    ```
    
    Should work now.
