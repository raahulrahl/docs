# Bindu Edge Client

The Bindu Edge Client enables you to make your locally running agent accessible on the internet **without deploying** it to any cloud infrastructure. It creates a secure tunnel from your local machine to the internet using WebSocket connections, giving your development agent a publicly accessible URL.

<Info>
**Perfect for Development** - Test your agent in a production-like environment without the complexity of deployment, containerization, or cloud infrastructure setup.
</Info>

## Why Use Bindu Edge?

### 1. Zero-Deployment Development

Focus on building, not deploying:
- **Instant public access**: Get a public URL for your local agent in seconds
- **No Docker required**: Skip containerization during development
- **No cloud setup**: Avoid complex cloud deployments while iterating
- **Keep working locally**: Use your familiar development environment and tools
- **Live reload**: Changes to your local code are immediately accessible via the public URL

### 2. Rapid Testing & Iteration

Speed up your development workflow:
- **Test webhooks locally**: Receive callbacks from external services directly to your local agent
- **Integration testing**: Test with third-party APIs that require public endpoints
- **Real-world scenarios**: Simulate production conditions without production deployment
- **Quick debugging**: Debug issues in a public-facing context while keeping full IDE access
- **Instant sharing**: Share your work-in-progress with team members or stakeholders

### 3. Secure Tunneling

Enterprise-grade security for development tunnels:
- **Token-based authentication**: Every tunnel requires a secure authentication token
- **Encrypted connections**: All traffic flows through secure WebSocket (WSS) connections
- **Request validation**: Only authorized requests are forwarded to your local agent
- **Private by default**: Tunnels are only accessible with the correct URL and token
- **Temporary access**: Create and destroy tunnels on-demand for specific testing sessions

### 4. A2A Protocol Compatible

Seamlessly integrate with the agent-to-agent ecosystem:
- **DID support**: Your local agent maintains its Decentralized Identity
- **Protocol compliance**: Full A2A protocol support through the tunnel
- **Message routing**: Receive tasks and messages from other agents on the internet
- **Discovery**: Make your local agent discoverable in the Bindu Directory
- **Agent networking**: Test multi-agent interactions without deploying all agents

### 5. Perfect for Demos

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- A Bindu agent running locally
- Access to [bindus.directory](https://bindus.directory)
- Python environment with Bindu installed

### Step 1: Create a Tunnel

Visit [bindus.directory](https://bindus.directory) and set up your tunnel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to your account">
    Navigate to bindus.directory and authenticate with your credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to tunnels section">
    Find the "Tunnels" or "Edge" section in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new tunnel">
    Click "Create Tunnel" and configure your tunnel settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After creation, you'll receive three critical pieces of information:

- **`ws_url`**: WebSocket URL for the tunnel connection (e.g., `wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws`)
- **`token`**: Authentication token for secure access (e.g., `bnd_tk_abc123...`)
- **`public_url`**: Your agent's public internet URL (e.g., `https://agent-abc.bindus.directory`)

<Warning>
Keep your `token` secure! It grants access to forward traffic to your local machine. Never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Configure Your Local Agent

Create an `edge.config.json` file in your project directory:

```json edge.config.json
{
  "ws_url": "wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/your-tunnel-id",
  "token": "bnd_tk_your_secret_token_here",
  "local_port": 3773
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

| Field | Description | Default | Required |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `ws_url` | WebSocket URL provided by bindus.directory | - | ✅ Yes |
| `token` | Authentication token for your tunnel | - | ✅ Yes |
| `local_port` | Port where your local agent is running | `3773` | ❌ No |

<Tip>
The `local_port` defaults to `3773` (Bindu's default port). Only change this if your agent runs on a different port.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Start Your Local Agent

Ensure your Bindu agent is running on the configured port:

```bash
# Standard Bindu agent startup
uv run python -m your_agent

# Or with uvicorn directly
uvicorn your_agent.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3773
```

Verify your agent is accessible locally:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3773/health
```

### Step 4: Start the Edge Client

With your agent running, start the edge client in a new terminal:

```bash
uv run python -m bindu.edge_client
```

You should see output confirming the connection:
```
🌐 Bindu Edge Client Starting...
✓ Connected to tunnel: wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/your-tunnel-id
✓ Authentication successful
✓ Local agent detected on port 3773
✅ Your agent is now live at: https://agent-abc.bindus.directory

Press Ctrl+C to stop the tunnel
```

### Step 5: Test the Connection

Your agent is now publicly accessible! Test it:

```bash
# From anywhere on the internet
curl https://agent-abc.bindus.directory/health
```

Or send an A2A protocol message:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agent-abc.bindus.directory/a2a/task/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_id": "test-task-001",
    "input": {
      "action": "greet",
      "message": "Hello from the internet!"
    }
  }'
```

<Success>
**That's it!** 🎉 Your local agent is now accessible on the internet at your `public_url`.
</Success>

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

Instead of using `edge.config.json`, you can set environment variables:

```bash
export BINDU_EDGE_WS_URL="wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/your-tunnel-id"
export BINDU_EDGE_TOKEN="bnd_tk_your_secret_token"
export BINDU_EDGE_LOCAL_PORT="3773"

uv run python -m bindu.edge_client
```

### Custom Port Configuration

If your agent runs on a non-standard port:

```json edge.config.json
{
  "ws_url": "wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/your-tunnel-id",
  "token": "bnd_tk_your_secret_token",
  "local_port": 8080  // Custom port
}
```

### Multiple Agents

Run multiple agents with separate tunnels:

**Terminal 1 - Agent A on port 3773:**
```bash
# edge-agent-a.config.json
{
  "ws_url": "wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/tunnel-a",
  "token": "bnd_tk_token_a",
  "local_port": 3773
}

uv run python -m bindu.edge_client --config edge-agent-a.config.json
```

**Terminal 2 - Agent B on port 3774:**
```bash
# edge-agent-b.config.json
{
  "ws_url": "wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/tunnel-b",
  "token": "bnd_tk_token_b",
  "local_port": 3774
}

uv run python -m bindu.edge_client --config edge-agent-b.config.json
```

### Programmatic Usage

Integrate Edge Client into your code:

```python
from bindu.edge_client import EdgeClient
import asyncio

async def main():
    client = EdgeClient(
        ws_url="wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/your-tunnel-id",
        token="bnd_tk_your_secret_token",
        local_port=3773
    )
    
    await client.connect()
    print(f"✅ Agent accessible at: {client.public_url}")
    
    # Keep running
    try:
        await client.run_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        await client.disconnect()
        print("👋 Tunnel closed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

```
Internet Request → Bindu Edge Server → WebSocket Tunnel → Local Agent
                  (bindus.directory)                      (localhost:3773)
```

**Request Flow:**

1. **Incoming Request**: External client sends request to `https://agent-abc.bindus.directory`
2. **Edge Server**: Bindu Edge server receives and validates the request
3. **Authentication**: Server verifies the request against tunnel configuration
4. **WebSocket Forward**: Request is forwarded through the WebSocket tunnel
5. **Local Processing**: Edge client receives request and forwards to `localhost:3773`
6. **Agent Response**: Your local agent processes and returns response
7. **Return Path**: Response flows back through tunnel to Edge server
8. **Client Response**: Original client receives response from your local agent

### Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EC as Edge Client
    participant ES as Edge Server
    participant LA as Local Agent
    participant C as Internet Client

    EC->>ES: WebSocket Connect (ws_url + token)
    ES->>EC: Authentication Success
    EC->>LA: Health Check (localhost:3773)
    LA->>EC: 200 OK
    EC->>ES: Ready for Traffic
    
    C->>ES: HTTP Request (public_url)
    ES->>EC: Forward via WebSocket
    EC->>LA: HTTP Request (localhost)
    LA->>EC: HTTP Response
    EC->>ES: Forward via WebSocket
    ES->>C: HTTP Response
```

### Security Model

**Multi-Layer Security:**

1. **Token Authentication**: Every tunnel requires a unique token
2. **WSS Encryption**: WebSocket connections use TLS encryption
3. **Request Validation**: Edge server validates all incoming requests
4. **Local Firewall**: Your local machine's firewall remains intact
5. **No Port Forwarding**: No need to open ports or configure routers

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Problem: "Cannot connect to tunnel"**

```bash
❌ Error: Failed to connect to wss://tunnel.bindus.directory/ws/tunnel-id
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify your `ws_url` is correct and includes the tunnel ID
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure the tunnel still exists at bindus.directory
4. Verify no firewall is blocking WebSocket connections

### Authentication Failures

**Problem: "Authentication failed"**

```bash
❌ Error: Token authentication failed
```

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check your `token` value in `edge.config.json`
2. Ensure the token hasn't expired (check bindus.directory dashboard)
3. Verify you haven't regenerated the token since creating the config
4. Check for extra spaces or quotes in the token string

### Local Agent Not Found

**Problem: "Cannot reach local agent"**

```bash
❌ Error: Connection refused to localhost:3773
```

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your Bindu agent is actually running
2. Verify it's listening on the correct port (`local_port` in config)
3. Check if another process is using the port: `lsof -i :3773`
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:3773/health` directly

### Request Timeout

**Problem: Requests timeout through the tunnel**

**Solutions:**
1. Check if your local agent is responding slowly
2. Increase timeout settings in your agent configuration
3. Verify your internet connection stability
4. Check Edge client logs for error messages

### Port Already in Use

**Problem: Edge client can't bind**

```bash
❌ Error: Address already in use
```

**Solutions:**
1. Another Edge client might already be running
2. Kill existing process: `pkill -f bindu.edge_client`
3. Find and stop the conflicting process: `lsof -i :3773`

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with local testing** before enabling the tunnel
2. **Use tunnels temporarily** - close them when not needed
3. **Rotate tokens regularly** for security
4. **Monitor logs** from both agent and edge client
5. **Test locally first** before exposing via tunnel

### Security Guidelines

<Warning>
**Never share your tunnel token publicly.** It grants direct access to your local machine.
</Warning>

- ✅ **DO**: Store tokens in `edge.config.json` (add to `.gitignore`)
- ✅ **DO**: Use environment variables in shared environments
- ✅ **DO**: Rotate tokens after demos or testing sessions
- ✅ **DO**: Delete unused tunnels from bindus.directory
- ❌ **DON'T**: Commit `edge.config.json` to version control
- ❌ **DON'T**: Share tunnel URLs without authentication
- ❌ **DON'T**: Leave tunnels running when not in use
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use production credentials in tunneled agents

### Performance Tips

- **Close idle tunnels**: Each tunnel consumes resources
- **Use local testing first**: Only tunnel when you need public access
- **Monitor bandwidth**: Large file transfers may be slow
- **Check latency**: Tunnel adds ~50-200ms latency depending on location
- **Limit concurrent requests**: Local machine may not handle production load

### Git Configuration

Add to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Bindu Edge Client
edge.config.json
*.edge.config.json
.bindu-edge/
```
