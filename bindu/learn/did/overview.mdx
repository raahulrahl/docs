Bindu uses **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** to provide secure, verifiable, and self-sovereign identity for AI agents. Each agent gets a unique DID that serves as its cryptographic identity across the network.

## What is a DID?

A **DID (Decentralized Identifier)** is a globally unique identifier that:
- **Doesn't require a central authority** - No single entity controls it
- **Is cryptographically verifiable** - Backed by public/private key pairs
- **Is persistent** - Remains valid across platforms and time
- **Enables trust** - Verify agent authenticity without intermediaries

### DID Format

Bindu DIDs follow the W3C standard structure:

```
did:bindu:<email>:<agent_name>:<unique_hash>
```

**Example:**
```
did:bindu:gaurikasethi88_at_gmail_com:echo_agent:352c17d030fb4bf1ab33d04b102aef3d
```

## DID Resolution

Retrieve a DID document for an agent:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3773/did/resolve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "did": "did:bindu:gaurikasethi88_at_gmail_com:echo_agent:352c17d030fb4bf1ab33d04b102aef3d"
  }'
```

### DID Document Structure

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
        "https://getbindu.com/ns/v1"
    ],
    "id": "did:bindu:gaurikasethi88_at_gmail_com:echo_agent:352c17d030fb4bf1ab33d04b102aef3d",
    "created": "2026-02-11T05:33:56.969079+00:00",
    "authentication": [
        {
            "id": "did:bindu:...#key-1",
            "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
            "controller": "did:bindu:...",
            "publicKeyBase58": "<base58-encoded-public-key>"
        }
    ]
}
```

## DID Generation

When you create a Bindu agent, a DID is automatically generated:

```python
config = {
    "author": "your.email@example.com",
    "name": "my_agent",
    "description": "My AI agent"
}

bindufy(config, handler)
# DID generated: did:bindu:your_email_at_example_com:my_agent:<hash>
```

## Message Signing

Agents sign responses with their private key. The signature is included in task response metadata:

```json
{
    "artifacts": [
        {
            "parts": [
                {
                    "kind": "text",
                    "text": "The capital of India is **New Delhi**.",
                    "metadata": {
                        "did.message.signature": "<base58-signature>"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

This signature proves:
- **Authenticity** - Message came from the agent with this DID
- **Integrity** - Message hasn't been tampered with
- **Non-repudiation** - Agent cannot deny sending the message

## Security Best Practices

**Private Key Protection:**
- Never hardcode keys in code
- Don't commit keys to version control
- Use secure key storage solutions
- Back up keys securely

**Key Rotation:**
- Rotate keys every 90-180 days
- Update after team changes
- Follow compliance requirements

## Standards

Bindu DIDs follow W3C standards:
- [W3C DID Core Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
- [DID Method Registry](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/)
- Ed25519 signature scheme (RFC 8032)
