# Contributing to Bindu

> Learn how to contribute to Bindu through our fork and pull request workflow.

Bindu is an open-source project and we welcome contributions.

## 👩‍💻 How to contribute

Please follow the [fork and pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow:

* Fork the repository.
* Create a new branch for your feature.
* Add your feature or improvement.
* Send a pull request.
* We appreciate your support & input!

## Development setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment:
   * For Unix, use `./scripts/dev_setup.sh`.
   * This setup will:
     * Create a `.venv` virtual environment in the current directory.
     * Install the required packages.
     * Install the `bindu` package in editable mode.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   * On Unix: `source .venv/bin/activate` 

> From here on you have to use `uv pip install` to install missing packages

## Formatting and validation

Ensure your code meets our quality standards by running the appropriate formatting and validation script before submitting a pull request:

* For Unix:
  * `./scripts/format.sh` 
  * `./scripts/validate.sh` 

These scripts will perform code formatting with `ruff` and static type checks with `mypy`.
