## General

### What is Bindu?

Bindu is an AI agent framework for A2A, AP2, and X402. It handles infrastructure identity, observability, and payments.

### How does the A2A protocol work?

The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol is a standardized communication layer. It allows different agents to talk, share information, and collaborate with each other automatically.

## Getting Started

### How do I create my first agent?

Just add the `bindufy()` function to your code. It takes about two minutes to transform your agent into a web-ready node.

### What are Skills and how do I define them?

Skills are your agent's "powers" like searching the web or querying a database. You define them in a simple configuration file to tell your agent exactly what to do.

---

## Agent Discovery & Identity

### How does agent discovery work?

Every Bindu agent has a unique digital ID (DID). It makes your agent easy to find, verify, and allows systems to "discover" and communicate for tasks.

### How do I integrate with enterprise identity providers?

Bindu uses Decentralized Identifiers to keep identities secure. This makes it easy to link your agent's enterprise identity.

---

## Payments & Security

### What is the AP2 payment protocol?

It allows your agent to bill other agents for its services autonomously, handling transactions without you needing to send manual invoices.

### How do I secure my agent with trust levels?

Security is built-in through DID authentication. You can specify which agents are allowed to talk to your other agents.

---

## Deployment & Architecture

### Can I deploy agents to production?

Absolutely. Bindu provides the professional routing, error handling, and monitoring you need to scale your agent from a local script to a real-world service.

### What's the difference between agents, teams, and workflows?

- **Agents** - Solo intelligence focused on one job
- **Workflows** - A set, step-by-step path for agents to follow
- **Teams** - A group of agents working together to solve complex problems
