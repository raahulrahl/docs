## How It Works

**Premium Instructions**
- Defines expertise: blockchain analysis, market trends, risk assessment
- Structured output: insights, risk assessments, recommendations
- High-value focus to justify payment cost

**X402 Payment Gating**
- `execution_cost`: Payment configuration
- `amount`: 0.01 USDC per query
- `network`: base-sepolia (testnet)
- `pay_to_address`: Recipient wallet address
- Payment required before agent responds

**Handler**
- Protected by X402 paywall
- Only executes after payment confirmation
- Returns premium market insights

**Model**
- `openai/gpt-oss-120b`: Advanced financial reasoning
- Provides actionable investment advice

## Run

```bash
# Set API key
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here" > examples/premium-advisor/.env

# Run agent
uv run examples/premium-advisor/premium_advisor.py
```

Try: "What are the best investment opportunities right now?"

**Payment Required**: You'll need 0.01 USDC on Base Sepolia to test.
