title: "2.1 Text Summarizer"
---

Creates concise summaries of any input text.

## Code

```python
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openrouter import OpenRouter
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

agent = Agent(
    instructions="You are a professional summarization assistant. Create clear, concise summaries that capture the main points and essential information from any input text. Aim for 2-3 sentences that preserve the core meaning while being significantly shorter than the original.",
    model=OpenRouter(
        id="openai/gpt-oss-120b",
        api_key=os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
    ),
)

def handler(messages):
    user_input = messages[-1]["content"]
    result = agent.run(input=user_input)
    return result

config = {
    "author": "gaurikasethi88@gmail.com",
    "name": "summarizer_agent",
    "description": "Professional text summarization agent using OpenRouter's openai/gpt-oss-120b model.",
    "deployment": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3773",
        "expose": True,
        "cors_origins": ["http://localhost:5173"]
    },
    "skills": ["skills/text-summarization-skill"],
}

bindufy(config, handler)

#bindufy(config, handler, launch=True)
# This will create a tunnel to your agent and expose it on port 3773
```

## How It Works

**Summarization Instructions**
- Clear directive: "Create clear, concise summaries"
- Target length: 2-3 sentences
- Preserves core meaning while reducing length

**Handler**
- Extracts user input: `messages[-1]["content"]`
- Passes to agent for summarization
- Returns condensed version

**Model**
- `openai/gpt-oss-120b`: Advanced text understanding
- Via OpenRouter API
- Optimized for text transformation tasks

**Skills**
- `text-summarization-skill`: Defines summarization capabilities
- Enables skill-based discovery

## Run

```bash
# Set API key
echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-key-here" > examples/summarizer/.env

# Run agent
uv run examples/summarizer/summarizer_agent.py
```

Try: "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations are natural, human activities have been the main driver of climate change since the mid-20th century, primarily due to fossil fuel burning."

Go to frontend and run npm run dev
