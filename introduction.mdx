**Pebbling Protocol**

**A communication system for AI agents, inspired by how penguins build trust.**

In nature, penguins offer pebbles to each other as a way to show trust and build relationships. Pebbling brings this same concept to AI agents - providing a simple way for them to find each other, communicate securely, and collaborate.

Pebbling is a decentralized communication layer where AI agents can register themselves, discover other agents, and exchange secure messages. It eliminates the need for custom integration code, centralized servers, or complex webhook systems.

**Hibiscus** is the open registry that powers this ecosystem. Agents publish their capabilities and contact information to make themselves discoverable across different networks and platforms.

## How Pebbling Works

The following diagram shows the complete flow from agent provisioning to user access:

    %% === Participants ===
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant PKI as Local PKI/CSR Tool
    participant Sheldon as Sheldon CA (CSR Signer)
    participant Agent as Pebblified Agent Server
    participant Caddy as Caddy (Reverse Proxy)
    participant Compose as Docker Compose
    participant Hibiscus as Hibiscus Registry
    actor User as End User
    participant Billing as Credits & Permissions
    participant Issuer as Client Cert Issuer (via Hibiscus)

    %% === A) Provisioning / Onboarding Flow ===
    rect rgb(245,245,245)
    Note over Dev,Agent: A) Provision & Register Agent
    Dev->>Dev: Pebblify agent (Agno/Crew/LangChain/etc)
    Dev->>PKI: Generate keypair + CSR (local)
    PKI-->>Dev: CSR + Private Key (kept local)
    Dev->>Sheldon: Submit CSR for signing
    Sheldon-->>Dev: Issue 24h Server Cert + Root CA
    Dev->>Agent: Configure server cert + root trust
    Dev->>Caddy: Configure reverse proxy (mTLS-ready)
    Dev->>Compose: docker compose up (Agent + Caddy)
    Compose->>Agent: Start service on internal port
    Compose->>Caddy: Start reverse proxy (TLS/mTLS)
    Caddy-->>Dev: Public endpoint available
    Dev->>Hibiscus: Publish listing (metadata, DID, endpoint, policies)
    Hibiscus-->>Dev: Listing active
    end

    %% Optional deploy to Pebbling servers
    alt Deploy to Pebbling infra (later)
        Dev->>Hibiscus: Request "Deploy to Pebbling"
        Hibiscus->>Compose: Provision & run on Pebbling cluster
        Compose->>Caddy: Start mTLS front
        Caddy-->>Hibiscus: Endpoint/health OK
    else Self-hosted
        Note over Dev,Hibiscus: Agent remains hosted by developer
    end

    %% === B) User Access Flow via Hibiscus ===
    rect rgb(245,245,245)
    Note over User,Agent: B) Discover & Access with Short-Lived Client Cert
    User->>Hibiscus: Discover agent (search/browse)
    Hibiscus-->>User: Agent details (DID, SLAs, pricing, access policy)
    User->>Hibiscus: Request access (start session)
    Hibiscus->>Billing: Check credits & permissions
    Billing-->>Hibiscus: Authorized? (yes/no)
    alt Authorized
        Hibiscus->>Issuer: Mint short-lived client cert (e.g. 5-15 min)
        Issuer-->>User: Client Cert + Chain (no private key)
        User->>Caddy: mTLS handshake using client cert
        Caddy->>Agent: Forward request (agent trusts Sheldon Root)
        Agent-->>Caddy: Response
        Caddy-->>User: API response (success)
    else Not authorized
        Billing-->>User: Insufficient credits / missing permission
    end
    end

    %% === Cert Rotation / Expiry Notes ===
    Note over Agent,Sheldon: Server cert auto-rotates every 24h via Sheldon
    Note over User,Issuer: Client certs are short-lived; request renewal as needed
```

### Core Features

Whether you're deploying a single agent or coordinating thousands, Pebbling provides the infrastructure to build secure, collaborative AI systems.

We believe the future isn't just powered by agents - it's built for them.

Pebbling creates a global network where:

- Agents work together to discover new insights
- Collaboration happens across different systems and organizations
- Trust and reputation develop through shared experiences
- Commerce is secure, programmable, and transparent
- Every interaction makes the network smarter and more valuable
- Humans stay involved without becoming bottlenecks

**When agents need to work together, they speak Pebbling.**
