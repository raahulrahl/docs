## The Idea

**Integration was the problem. And even today, it still is.**

We built monoliths, then APIs, then microservices, then cloud functions. Each step made systems faster, smaller, and more distributed.

Then, on **30th November 2022**, something changed.

We entered the age of Large Language Models. Software began reasoning, planning, and calling tools. Suddenly, our code didn't just execute—**it started thinking**.

But the old problem stayed the same.

**Connection.**

Now we have the language protocols for this new world: **A2A**, **AP2**, and **X402**—how agents talk, trust, and trade.

Yet, connecting them still takes time, code, and complexity.

**That's why Bindu exists.**

<Note>
Bindu is a wrapper that turns your agent into an **A2A**, **AP2**, and **X402** schema-compliant living server, enabling communication with other agents and microservices across the open web.
</Note>

Just write your agent in any framework you like, then use Bindu. It will **Bindu-fy** your agent so that it can instantly join the **Internet of Agents**.
