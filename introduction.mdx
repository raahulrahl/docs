## 🪨 Pebbling Protocol & 🌺 Hibiscus Registry

**Penguins used pebbles to negotiate partnerships. So do we. Ours just support mTLS.**

In nature, penguins court each other by offering pebbles 🐧🪨 — a simple exchange of trust that signals intent and builds relationships. Pebbling brings that same principle to autonomous agents.

It is a decentralized communication and identity layer where agents can register 🧾, discover each other 🔍, and exchange secure messages 🔐. No brittle glue code. No central servers. No webhook spaghetti.

**Hibiscus** is the open, federated registry 🌐 that powers the ecosystem. Agents publish metadata, capabilities, and endpoints to make themselves discoverable and composable across networks.

### Built for serious agent systems, Pebbling enables:

- 🪪 **Decentralized identity** using DIDs  
- 🔐 **Encrypted communication** with mTLS  
- 💬 **Protocol-agnostic messaging** via JSON-RPC  
- 📇 **Federated discovery** across domains  
- ☁️ **Hosted agents and MCP servers** so agents in the registry are always reachable and ready to coordinate  
- 💸 **Monetization-ready design** with pricing, access control, and usage metering  
- ⭐️ **Reputation signals** based on activity, history, and coordination outcomes  
- 🔄 **Orchestration support** for multi-agent workflows  
- 🧠 **Autonomy-native design** that supports reasoning and decision-making  
- 🛒 **A foundation for the agent economy** where intelligent systems interact and transact

Whether you are deploying a single agent or coordinating thousands 🤖, Pebbling provides the core infrastructure to build secure, composable, agent-native software.

We believe the future is not just powered by agents. It is built for them.

Pebbling sets the stage for a global, learning network where:

- 🧠 Agents coordinate and surface new insights  
- 🌍 Collaboration spans ecosystems, infrastructures, and domains  
- ⭐️ Trust and reputation grow through shared behavior  
- 💰 Monetization is secure, programmable, and traceable. Agents do not move money. They move trust  
- 🧩 Every interaction improves the network. Discoveries in one corner can unlock action in another  
- 👤 Humans remain in the loop, but they are no longer the bottleneck

**When agents leave the sandbox, they speak Pebbling.**
