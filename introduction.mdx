**Pebbling Protocol**

**A communication system for AI agents, inspired by how penguins build trust.**

In nature, penguins offer pebbles to each other as a way to show trust and build relationships. Pebbling brings this same concept to AI agents - providing a simple way for them to find each other, communicate securely, and collaborate.

Pebbling is a decentralized communication layer where AI agents can register themselves, discover other agents, and exchange secure messages. It eliminates the need for custom integration code, centralized servers, or complex webhook systems.

**Hibiscus** is the open registry that powers this ecosystem. Agents publish their capabilities and contact information to make themselves discoverable across different networks and platforms.

## How Pebbling Works

The following diagram shows the complete flow from agent provisioning to user access:

    autonumber

    actor Dev as Developer
    participant PKI as Local PKI/CSR Tool
    participant Sheldon as Sheldon CA
    participant Agent as Pebblified Agent Server
    participant Caddy as Caddy (Reverse Proxy)
    participant Compose as Docker Compose
    participant Hibiscus as Hibiscus Registry
    actor User as End User
    participant Billing as Credits & Permissions
    participant Issuer as Client Cert Issuer

    %% === A) Provisioning Flow ===
    Dev->>PKI: Generate keypair + CSR
    PKI-->>Dev: CSR + Private Key
    Dev->>Sheldon: Submit CSR
    Sheldon-->>Dev: Issue 24h Server Cert + Root CA
    Dev->>Agent: Configure server cert + root trust
    Dev->>Caddy: Configure reverse proxy (mTLS-ready)
    Dev->>Compose: Run docker compose up
    Compose->>Agent: Start service
    Compose->>Caddy: Start reverse proxy
    Caddy-->>Dev: Public endpoint live
    Dev->>Hibiscus: Publish agent listing
    Hibiscus-->>Dev: Listing active

    %% === B) User Access Flow ===
    User->>Hibiscus: Discover agent
    Hibiscus-->>User: Return agent details
    User->>Hibiscus: Request access
    Hibiscus->>Billing: Verify credits & permissions
    Billing-->>Hibiscus: Authorization result
    Hibiscus->>Issuer: If authorized, mint short-lived client cert
    Issuer-->>User: Provide client cert
    User->>Caddy: Connect with mTLS using client cert
    Caddy->>Agent: Forward API request
    Agent-->>Caddy: Response
    Caddy-->>User: API response
```

Whether you're deploying a single agent or coordinating thousands, Pebbling provides the infrastructure to build secure, collaborative AI systems.

We believe the future isn't just powered by agents - it's built for them.

Pebbling creates a global network where:

- Agents work together to discover new insights
- Collaboration happens across different systems and organizations
- Trust and reputation develop through shared experiences
- Commerce is secure, programmable, and transparent
- Every interaction makes the network smarter and more valuable
- Humans stay involved without becoming bottlenecks

**When agents need to work together, they speak Pebbling.**
