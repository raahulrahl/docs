title: 'Retry Mechanism'
---

## Overview

Intelligent retry logic for handling transient failures in agent communication, using [Tenacity](https://github.com/jd/tenacity) for robust retry strategies.

**Goal:** Graceful handling of network issues, timeouts, and temporary service outages

## Features

**Exponential Backoff** - Increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...)  
**Jittered Retry** - Add randomness to prevent thundering herd  
**Circuit Breaker** - Stop retrying if service is consistently down  
**Error Classification** - Retry transient errors, fail fast on permanent ones

## Use Cases

- Agent-to-agent communication failures
- External API timeouts
- Database connection issues
- Payment processing retries

## Implementation

Using Tenacity for retry logic:

```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(
    stop=stop_after_attempt(5),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=1, max=30)
)
async def send_message(agent_id, message):
    # Automatically retries on failure
    ...
```

## Status

📋 **Planned** - Will integrate Tenacity for production reliability
