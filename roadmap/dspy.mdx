## What is This?

**The Problem:** Writing good prompts for AI agents is hard. You write a prompt, test it, tweak it, test again... it takes forever.

**The Solution:** Let your agent **learn from real users** and automatically improve its prompts over time.

## Simple Analogy

Imagine you're teaching someone to answer customer questions:

**Old Way (Manual):**
- You write instructions
- They answer questions
- You manually rewrite instructions based on what worked
- Repeat forever ❌

**New Way (DSPy + Bindu):**
- You write basic instructions
- They answer questions
- Users say "good answer" or "bad answer"
- The system automatically learns what works
- Instructions improve themselves ✅

## How It Works (Simple Steps)

```
1. Your agent answers questions (with basic prompts)
   ↓
2. Users give feedback: 👍 "Good answer" or 👎 "Bad answer"
   ↓
3. Bindu collects all the 👍 good examples
   ↓
4. DSPy studies what made them good
   ↓
5. DSPy rewrites your prompts to be better
   ↓
6. Your agent is now smarter! 🎉
```

**In One Sentence:**
Your agent learns from real users and gets better automatically.

## Why This is Amazing

**Without This:**
- You spend hours tweaking prompts ⏰
- You guess what works 🤔
- Your agent stays the same forever 📉
- You don't know if changes help or hurt ❓

**With This:**
- Your agent learns from real users 👥
- It improves automatically 🤖
- It gets smarter over time 📈
- You see exactly what works 📊

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Users Give Feedback

Bindu automatically tracks everything. Users just rate responses:

```python
from bindu import bindufy

agent = bindufy(my_agent, config, handler)

# That's it! Bindu tracks all interactions automatically.
# Users can rate responses:
# ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Perfect answer!"
# ⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Good, but could be better"
# ⭐⭐ "Not helpful"
```

**What happens:**
- Every conversation is saved
- Users rate how helpful the answer was
- Bindu remembers which answers got 5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Step 2: Collect the Good Examples

```python
from bindu.dspy import create_golden_dataset

# Get all the 5-star examples
golden_dataset = create_golden_dataset(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    min_rating=4,  # Only grab 4 and 5 star responses
    limit=100       # Get 100 examples
)

# Save them
golden_dataset.export("good_examples.json")
```

**What this does:**
- Finds all your best responses (4+ stars)
- Saves them in a file
- These become your "teaching examples"

### Step 3: Test the New Version Safely

Bindu lets you test improved prompts without breaking things:

```python
agent = bindufy(my_agent, config, handler)

# Your original prompts
agent.deploy_prompt_version("v1", "original.json")

# DSPy's improved prompts
agent.deploy_prompt_version("v2", "improved.json")

# Test carefully: send 10% of users to new version
agent.set_routing({
    "v1": 0.9,  # 90% get old version (safe)
    "v2": 0.1   # 10% get new version (testing)
})

# If v2 is better, gradually increase:
agent.set_routing({
    "v1": 0.5,  # 50% old
    "v2": 0.5   # 50% new
})

# If v2 is worse, easy to go back:
agent.set_routing({
    "v1": 1.0,  # Everyone back to old version
    "v2": 0.0
})
```

**Why this is safe:**
- Start with 10% of users (if it breaks, only 10% affected)
- Compare which version gets better ratings
- Gradually increase if it's working
- Instantly rollback if something goes wrong

## Real Examples

**Customer Support Agent:**
- Answers customer questions
- Customers rate answers
- Learns which answers make customers happy
- Gets better at helping customers

**Research Agent:**
- Finds information for users
- Users rate accuracy
- Learns what "good research" looks like
- Becomes more accurate over time

**Code Helper:**
- Writes code for developers
- Developers say if code works
- Learns what "good code" means
- Writes better code next time

**Data Analyst:**
- Analyzes data and gives insights
- Users verify if insights are correct
- Learns what makes good analysis
- Provides better insights

## Current Status

🚀 **In Progress** - We're building this now!

## The Big Picture

**Traditional AI Agent:**
```
You write prompts → Agent uses them forever → Never improves
```

**Bindu + DSPy Agent:**
```
You write basic prompts → Agent learns from users → Gets better automatically → Keeps improving
```

## Simple Summary

**What DSPy Does:**
Automatically rewrites your prompts to make them better

**What Bindu Does:**
Collects real user feedback so DSPy knows what "better" means

**Together:**
Your agent learns from real users and improves itself over time

**You Get:**
- Smarter agents without manual work ✅
- Learning from real usage, not guessing ✅
- Safe testing before full rollout ✅
- Continuous improvement ✅
