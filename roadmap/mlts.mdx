title: 'mTLS (Mutual TLS) Support'
---

## Overview

**The Problem:** When agents communicate, how do you know they are who they claim to be? How do you prevent man-in-the-middle attacks?

**The Solution:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) - Both client and server authenticate each other using certificates, not just passwords or API keys.

## Why mTLS?

**Traditional Auth (API Keys):**
- ❌ Keys can be stolen or leaked
- ❌ No cryptographic proof of identity
- ❌ Difficult to rotate
- ❌ No protection against MITM attacks

**mTLS (Certificate-Based):**
- ✅ Cryptographic proof of identity
- ✅ Automatic encryption
- ✅ Protection against MITM attacks
- ✅ Certificate rotation built-in
- ✅ Works at the transport layer

## How It Works

```
Agent A wants to talk to Agent B:

1. Agent A presents its certificate
2. Agent B verifies A's certificate
3. Agent B presents its certificate
4. Agent A verifies B's certificate
5. ✅ Both authenticated, encrypted connection established
```

## Use Cases

**Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Secure A2A protocol messages  
**Enterprise Deployments** - Meet security compliance requirements  
**Multi-Tenant Platforms** - Isolate tenant agents  
**Production Environments** - Zero-trust architecture

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Certificate Infrastructure
- Set up Certificate Authority (CA)
- Generate agent certificates
- Certificate storage and rotation
- Revocation list management

### Phase 2: Bindu Integration
```python
from bindu import bindufy

config = {
    "security": {
        "mtls": {
            "enabled": True,
            "cert_path": "/path/to/agent-cert.pem",
            "key_path": "/path/to/agent-key.pem",
            "ca_path": "/path/to/ca-cert.pem"
        }
    }
}

bindufy(agent, config, handler)
```

### Phase 3: Client Support
- Update client SDKs to support mTLS
- Automatic certificate loading
- Certificate renewal handling

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Ops
- Certificate expiry monitoring
- Automated renewal
- Audit logging
- Revocation handling
