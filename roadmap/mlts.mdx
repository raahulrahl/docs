title: 'mTLS (Mutual TLS) Support'
---

## Overview

**The Problem:** When agents communicate, how do you know they are who they claim to be? How do you prevent man-in-the-middle attacks?

**The Solution:** Mutual TLS (mTLS) - Both client and server authenticate each other using certificates, not just passwords or API keys.

## Why mTLS?

**Traditional Auth (API Keys):**
- ❌ Keys can be stolen or leaked
- ❌ No cryptographic proof of identity
- ❌ Difficult to rotate
- ❌ No protection against MITM attacks

**mTLS (Certificate-Based):**
- ✅ Cryptographic proof of identity
- ✅ Automatic encryption
- ✅ Protection against MITM attacks
- ✅ Certificate rotation built-in
- ✅ Works at the transport layer

## How It Works

```
Agent A wants to talk to Agent B:

1. Agent A presents its certificate
2. Agent B verifies A's certificate
3. Agent B presents its certificate
4. Agent A verifies B's certificate
5. ✅ Both authenticated, encrypted connection established
```

## Use Cases

**Agent-to-Agent Communication** - Secure A2A protocol messages  
**Enterprise Deployments** - Meet security compliance requirements  
**Multi-Tenant Platforms** - Isolate tenant agents  
**Production Environments** - Zero-trust architecture

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Certificate Infrastructure
**Using Third-Party Certificate Authorities:**
- Support for Let's Encrypt, AWS Certificate Manager, HashiCorp Vault
- Integration with existing enterprise PKI
- Automatic certificate provisioning
- Certificate storage and rotation
- Revocation list management

We won't build our own CA—we'll integrate with proven third-party solutions.

### Phase 2: Bindu Integration

**Example 1: Using Let's Encrypt**
```python
from bindu import bindufy

config = {
    "security": {
        "mtls": {
            "enabled": True,
            "cert_path": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/agent.example.com/fullchain.pem",
            "key_path": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/agent.example.com/privkey.pem",
            "ca_path": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/agent.example.com/chain.pem"
        }
    }
}

bindufy(agent, config, handler)
```

**Example 2: Using AWS Certificate Manager**
```python
config = {
    "security": {
        "mtls": {
            "enabled": True,
            "provider": "aws_acm",
            "certificate_arn": "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/abc123",
            "region": "us-east-1"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example 3: Using HashiCorp Vault**
```python
config = {
    "security": {
        "mtls": {
            "enabled": True,
            "provider": "vault",
            "vault_addr": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
            "vault_token": "s.xxxxxx",
            "pki_path": "pki/issue/agent-role"
        }
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Client Support
- Update client SDKs to support mTLS
- Automatic certificate loading
- Certificate renewal handling

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Ops
- Certificate expiry monitoring
- Automated renewal
- Audit logging
- Revocation handling
