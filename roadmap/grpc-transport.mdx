title: 'gRPC Transport Support'
---

## Overview

Bindu currently uses **JSON-RPC 2.0** for agent communication. As the framework matures, we plan to add **gRPC** as an optional high-performance transport.

**Current:** JSON-RPC over HTTP (simple, human-readable, widely supported)  
**Future:** gRPC option for production workloads requiring high throughput

## Why Add gRPC?

**Performance** - Binary protocol, faster than JSON  
**Streaming** - Native bidirectional streaming for real-time updates  
**Type Safety** - Protocol buffers provide strong typing  
**HTTP/2** - Multiplexing and header compression

## Use Cases

When you need:
- High-throughput (thousands of requests/second)
- Real-time streaming (live data feeds)
- Low-latency (financial trading, gaming)
- Microservices (agent teams communicating internally)

## Implementation

gRPC will be added alongside JSON-RPC:
- Same A2A protocol, different transport
- Backward compatible with existing agents
- Optional—JSON-RPC remains the default

## Status

📋 **Planned** - Will add as Bindu matures and production needs emerge
