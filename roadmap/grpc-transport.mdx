# gRPC Transport Support

## Overview

Adding gRPC as a transport option alongside JSON-RPC and WebSocket for high-performance, low-latency agent-to-agent communication.

## Why gRPC?

- **Performance** - Binary protocol is faster than JSON
- **Streaming** - Native bidirectional streaming support
- **Type Safety** - Protocol buffers provide strong typing
- **Language Support** - Works across multiple programming languages
- **HTTP/2** - Multiplexing, header compression, and server push

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Unary RPC calls for request-response patterns
- Server streaming for real-time updates
- Client streaming for data uploads
- Bidirectional streaming for interactive sessions

### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing A2A protocol
- Automatic protocol buffer generation from TypedDict schemas
- Support for all existing message types (Task, Artifact, Context)
- Backward compatible with JSON-RPC endpoints

## Use Cases

- **High-throughput agents** - Processing thousands of requests per second
- **Real-time streaming** - Live data feeds and continuous updates
- **Microservices** - Agent teams communicating internally
- **Low-latency requirements** - Financial trading, gaming, IoT

## Implementation Plan

1. Define `.proto` files for A2A protocol messages
2. Generate Python stubs from protocol buffers
3. Implement gRPC server alongside existing transports
4. Add gRPC client support in SDK
5. Update AgentInterface to declare gRPC endpoints
6. Performance benchmarking vs JSON-RPC

## Status

ðŸš€ **In Progress** - Protocol buffer definitions and server implementation underway

## Timeline

- **Q1 2025** - Initial gRPC server implementation
- **Q2 2025** - Client SDK support and documentation
- **Q2 2025** - Production-ready release
