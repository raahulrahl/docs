# Negotiation Support

## Overview

Implementing agent-to-agent negotiation protocols for collaborative task execution, resource allocation, and consensus building.

## Why Negotiation?

- **Collaboration** - Agents work together to achieve goals
- **Resource Optimization** - Efficient allocation of limited resources
- **Conflict Resolution** - Handle competing objectives
- **Flexibility** - Adapt to changing requirements
- **Autonomy** - Agents make decisions without human intervention

## Negotiation Patterns

### Proposal-Response Pattern

```python
# Agent A proposes a task division
proposal = await agent_a.propose(
    task_id="complex-analysis",
    division={
        "data_collection": "agent_b",
        "analysis": "agent_a",
        "reporting": "agent_c"
    },
    deadline="2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
)

# Agent B responds
response = await agent_b.respond(
    proposal_id=proposal.id,
    status="counter_offer",
    counter_proposal={
        "data_collection": "agent_b",
        "preprocessing": "agent_b",  # Added step
        "analysis": "agent_a",
        "reporting": "agent_c"
    }
)
```

### Auction-Based Negotiation

```python
# Agent posts task for bidding
auction = await coordinator.create_auction(
    task="process_large_dataset",
    requirements={
        "min_memory_gb": 16,
        "max_duration_hours": 2,
        "skills": ["data_processing", "ml"]
    },
    deadline=datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1)
)

# Agents submit bids
bid = await agent.submit_bid(
    auction_id=auction.id,
    price_credits=100,
    estimated_time=timedelta(minutes=45),
    quality_score=0.95
)

# Coordinator selects winner
winner = await coordinator.select_winner(
    auction_id=auction.id,
    criteria="lowest_price"  # or "fastest", "highest_quality"
)
```

### Consensus Building

```python
# Multi-agent decision making
consensus = await team.reach_consensus(
    question="Which ML model to use?",
    options=["random_forest", "neural_network", "gradient_boosting"],
    voting_method="weighted",  # or "majority", "unanimous"
    timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
)
```

## Negotiation Protocols

### Contract Net Protocol
1. Task announcement
2. Bid submission
3. Bid evaluation
4. Contract award
5. Task execution
6. Result delivery

### Alternating Offers
1. Initial proposal
2. Counter-offer
3. Iterate until agreement or timeout
4. Finalize terms

### Mediated Negotiation
1. Agents submit preferences
2. Mediator proposes solution
3. Agents accept/reject
4. Iterate with mediator adjustments

## Features

### Negotiation Strategies

**Cooperative**
- Maximize joint utility
- Fair resource distribution
- Win-win outcomes

**Competitive**
- Maximize individual utility
- Strategic bidding
- Game theory optimization

**Adaptive**
- Learn from past negotiations
- Adjust strategy based on opponent
- Context-aware tactics

### Constraints & Preferences

```python
negotiation = Negotiation(
    hard_constraints={
        "max_price": 500,
        "min_quality": 0.8,
        "deadline": "2024-01-20"
    },
    soft_preferences={
        "prefer_faster": 0.7,
        "prefer_cheaper": 0.3
    },
    timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
)
```

### Agreement Enforcement

- Cryptographic commitments
- Smart contract integration
- Penalty mechanisms
- Reputation tracking

## Use Cases

### Task Allocation
- Distribute work among agent teams
- Load balancing
- Skill-based assignment

### Resource Sharing
- Compute resource allocation
- API quota distribution
- Database connection pooling

### Service Level Agreements
- Negotiate SLA terms
- Quality guarantees
- Pricing agreements

### Multi-Agent Planning
- Collaborative problem solving
- Distributed planning
- Conflict-free scheduling

## Monitoring & Analytics

- Negotiation success rates
- Average negotiation time
- Agreement satisfaction scores
- Strategy effectiveness
- Resource utilization

## Example: Multi-Agent Research

```python
# Research coordinator negotiates with specialist agents
coordinator = ResearchCoordinator()

# Negotiate data collection
data_agent = await coordinator.negotiate_with(
    agent_type="data_collector",
    task="gather_market_data",
    budget=200,
    quality_threshold=0.9
)

# Negotiate analysis
analysis_agent = await coordinator.negotiate_with(
    agent_type="data_analyst",
    task="statistical_analysis",
    input_from=data_agent,
    budget=300
)

# Negotiate report generation
report_agent = await coordinator.negotiate_with(
    agent_type="report_writer",
    task="generate_report",
    input_from=analysis_agent,
    format="pdf",
    budget=100
)
```
