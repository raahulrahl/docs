title: 'Negotiation Support'
---

## Overview

**The Story:** Humans negotiate everything—prices, resources, agreements. As LLM agents act on behalf of users, they need to negotiate too. But how well can they actually do it?

**The Solution:** [NegotiationArena](https://github.com/vinid/NegotiationArena) - A research platform that tests how well LLMs negotiate with each other through games and scenarios.

## Why This Matters

When agents negotiate:
- They split tasks among teams
- They allocate limited resources
- They resolve conflicts
- They reach consensus without human intervention

**The Research Question:** Can GPT-4 negotiate better than GPT-3.5? What strategies do they use? Do they cooperate or compete?

## What NegotiationArena Discovered

**"Babysitting" Effect:**
When a strong model (GPT-4) negotiates with a weaker one (GPT-3.5), GPT-4 often guides the conversation to help the weaker model—but makes worse offers for itself in the process.

**Reasoning Patterns:**
By analyzing agent conversations, researchers found LLMs use different negotiation strategies based on their initialization and opponent behavior.

## Use Cases in Bindu

**Task Allocation** - Agents negotiate who does what in a workflow  
**Resource Sharing** - Agents bid for compute resources or API quotas  
**Service Agreements** - Agents negotiate SLA terms and pricing  
**Collaborative Planning** - Multi-agent teams reach consensus on approach

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: NegotiationArena Integration
- Integrate NegotiationArena framework into Bindu
- Support game-based negotiation scenarios
- Enable agent-to-agent negotiation via A2A protocol

### Phase 2: Negotiation Protocols
```python
from bindu.negotiation import NegotiationGame

# Create negotiation scenario
game = NegotiationGame(
    scenario="task_allocation",
    agents=[agent_a, agent_b],
    rules={
        "max_rounds": 5,
        "timeout": timedelta(minutes=2)
    }
)

# Run negotiation
result = await game.play()
print(f"Agreement: {result.agreement}")
print(f"Payoffs: {result.payoffs}")
```

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Analytics
- Track negotiation success rates
- Analyze agent strategies
- Measure win rates and payoffs
- Export conversation logs for analysis

### Phase 4: Production Features
- Automatic negotiation for resource allocation
- Built-in negotiation strategies (cooperative, competitive, adaptive)
- Agreement enforcement with cryptographic commitments

## Status
