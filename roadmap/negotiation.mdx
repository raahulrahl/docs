## What is This?

Imagine two AI agents need to work together and split up tasks. How do they decide who does what?

**That's negotiation!** Just like humans negotiate prices or split chores, AI agents need to negotiate too.

## Simple Example

**Scenario:** Two agents need to complete 10 tasks, but each can only do 5.

**Without Negotiation:**
- Both try to do the same tasks ❌
- Some tasks never get done ❌
- Chaos! ❌

**With Negotiation:**
- Agent A: "I'll do tasks 1-5"
- Agent B: "I'll do tasks 6-10"
- Agreement reached ✅
- All tasks completed ✅

## Why Do Agents Need to Negotiate?

In the real world, agents need to:

**Share Resources:**
- "I need the database for 5 minutes"
- "Okay, I'll use it after you"

**Split Work:**
- "You handle customer emails"
- "I'll handle phone calls"

**Resolve Conflicts:**
- "We both want to use the API at the same time"
- "Let's take turns"

**Make Decisions:**
- "Should we use approach A or B?"
- "Let's vote and decide together"

## What We Learned from Research

Researchers tested how AI agents negotiate using [NegotiationArena](https://github.com/vinid/NegotiationArena).

### Interesting Discovery: The "Babysitting" Effect

**What happens:**
- Smart agent (GPT-4) negotiates with less smart agent (GPT-3.5)
- GPT-4 tries to help GPT-3.5 understand
- GPT-4 ends up accepting worse deals for itself

**It's like:**
A chess master playing with a beginner and letting them win to keep it fun.

### Different Strategies

AI agents use different negotiation styles:

**Cooperative:**
- "Let's both win"
- "How can we help each other?"

**Competitive:**
- "I want the best deal for me"
- "You take what's left"

**Adaptive:**
- Starts cooperative
- Becomes competitive if needed

## Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Task Splitting**
- 3 agents need to process 100 files
- They negotiate: "I'll do 40, you do 30, you do 30"
- Work gets done faster

**Example 2: Resource Sharing**
- 5 agents need to use the same database
- They negotiate time slots: "I'll use it 9-10am, you use it 10-11am"
- No conflicts, everyone gets a turn

**Example 3: Making Decisions**
- Team of agents needs to choose a solution
- They negotiate and vote
- Reach agreement without human help

**Example 4: Pricing**
- Agent A offers a service
- Agent B wants to use it
- They negotiate a fair price automatically

## How It Will Work in Bindu

### Simple Example Code

```python
from bindu.negotiation import NegotiationGame

# Set up a negotiation between two agents
game = NegotiationGame(
    scenario="split_tasks",
    agents=[agent_a, agent_b],
    rules={
        "max_rounds": 5,      # Try 5 times to reach agreement
        "timeout": "2 minutes" # Give up after 2 minutes
    }
)

# Let them negotiate
result = await game.play()

# See what they agreed on
print(f"Agreement: {result.agreement}")
print(f"Agent A gets: {result.agent_a_tasks}")
print(f"Agent B gets: {result.agent_b_tasks}")
```

### What You'll Get

**Built-in Strategies:**
- Cooperative ("let's both win")
- Competitive ("I want the best deal")
- Adaptive ("adjust based on situation")

**Automatic Tracking:**
- See which negotiations succeeded
- See which strategies work best
- Learn from past negotiations

**Safety Features:**
- Agreements are binding (can't back out)
- Time limits (no endless negotiations)
- Fair rules (no cheating)

## Current Status

🚀 **In Progress** - We're building this now!

## The Big Picture

**Without Negotiation:**
```
Agent A: "I'm doing task 1"
Agent B: "I'm doing task 1 too"
→ Conflict! ❌
→ Human has to step in and decide ❌
```

**With Negotiation:**
```
Agent A: "I want task 1"
Agent B: "I want task 1 too"
→ They negotiate ✅
→ Agent A gets task 1, Agent B gets task 2 ✅
→ Problem solved automatically! ✅
```

## Simple Summary

**What Negotiation Does:**
Lets AI agents make deals and agreements with each other

**Why It's Useful:**
- Agents can work together without human help
- Automatically split work fairly
- Resolve conflicts on their own
- Make group decisions

**Real Benefit:**
Your agents become a team that can organize themselves
