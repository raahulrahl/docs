title: 'Multi-Provider Authentication'
---

## What is This?

Authentication means **proving who you are** before you can use something.

Think of it like showing your ID card before entering a building. Bindu agents need this too - we need to know who's talking to them before they respond.

## Why Do We Need This?

Right now, anyone can talk to your Bindu agent. That's fine for testing, but dangerous in production.

With authentication:
- ✅ Only authorized users can access your agent
- ✅ You know who made each request
- ✅ Different users can have different permissions
- ✅ Your agent is safe from unauthorized access

## How Will This Work?

We're using **[Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra)** - think of it as a security guard for your agent.

### Why Ory Hydra?

It's like hiring a professional security company instead of building your own:

- **Proven & Trusted** - Thousands of companies already use it
- **Follows the Rules** - Uses standard security protocols (OAuth 2.0)
- **Easy to Scale** - Works whether you have 10 or 10,000 users
- **Very Secure** - Security experts regularly check it
- **Flexible** - You can customize how login works
- **Free & Open** - No licensing costs, you can see all the code

### How It Works (Simple Version)

```
1. User tries to access your Bindu agent
   ↓
2. Ory Hydra asks: "Who are you?"
   ↓
3. User logs in with GitHub/Google/etc.
   ↓
4. Ory Hydra gives user a "ticket" (token)
   ↓
5. User shows ticket to Bindu agent
   ↓
6. Bindu agent checks ticket is valid
   ↓
7. If valid → Agent responds
   If invalid → Access denied
```

**The Flow:**
```
User → Login with GitHub/Google → Get Ticket → Show Ticket to Agent → Access Granted
```

## Login Options

Users can log in with accounts they already have:

- **GitHub** - "Sign in with GitHub" (great for developers)
- **Google** - "Sign in with Google" (everyone has Gmail)
- **Microsoft** - "Sign in with Microsoft" (for companies using Office 365)
- **AWS** - For companies already using Amazon Web Services
- **Custom** - Your own login system if you have one

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Turn On Authentication in Your Agent

```python
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy

config = {
    "author": "your.email@example.com",
    "name": "my_secure_agent",
    "description": "My agent with login protection",
    "deployment": {
        "url": "http://localhost:3773",
        "expose": True
    },
    # Turn on authentication
    "auth": {
        "enabled": True,  # This turns it on!
        "hydra_url": "http://localhost:4444",  # Where Ory Hydra is running
        "allowed_providers": ["github", "google"],  # Which login options to allow
    },
    "skills": []
}

def handler(messages):
    # Your agent logic
    pass

bindufy(config, handler)
```

### Step 2: Start Ory Hydra (The Security Guard)

```bash
# Start Ory Hydra using Docker (easiest way)
docker run -d \
  --name hydra \
  -p 4444:4444 \
  -p 4445:4445 \
  oryd/hydra:v2.2.0 \
  serve all --dev

# Tell Ory Hydra about your Bindu agent
hydra create client \
  --endpoint http://localhost:4445 \
  --redirect-uri http://localhost:3773/callback
```

**What this does:**
- Starts the security guard (Ory Hydra)
- Tells it where your Bindu agent is
- Sets up the connection between them

### Step 3: Protect Your Agent's Endpoints

```python
from bindu.auth import require_auth

# This decorator means "check login first"
@require_auth()
async def my_protected_function(request):
    # Now we know who the user is!
    user = request.state.user
    print(f"User email: {user.email}")
    print(f"Logged in with: {user.provider}")  # "github" or "google"
    
    # Your agent logic here
    return {"message": f"Hello {user.email}!"}
```

**What this does:**
- Before running your function, checks if user is logged in
- If not logged in → Redirects to login page
- If logged in → Runs your function and gives you user info

## What You Get

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Log in once, access multiple agents
- **User Information** - Know who's using your agent
- **Different Permissions** - Give different users different access levels
- **Extra Security** - Support for 2-factor authentication (2FA)
- **Stay Logged In** - Users don't have to log in every time

## Current Status

🚀 **In Progress** - We're building this now!

## Why This is Good for You

- **Safe** - Security experts have tested it thoroughly
- **Standard** - Uses the same login system as Google, GitHub, etc.
- **Scalable** - Works for 10 users or 10,000 users
- **Free** - No licensing costs
- **Your Control** - You host it, you control it
- **Customizable** - Make the login page look how you want

## Simple Summary

**Before Authentication:**
- Anyone can access your agent ❌
- You don't know who's using it ❌
- Not safe for production ❌

**After Authentication:**
- Only logged-in users can access ✅
- You know exactly who's using it ✅
- Safe for production ✅
- Users can log in with GitHub, Google, etc. ✅
