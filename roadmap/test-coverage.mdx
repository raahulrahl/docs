---

## Overview

Comprehensive testing across Bindu to catch bugs early, enable confident refactoring, and maintain production reliability.

**Target:** 80% overall coverage with critical modules at 90%+

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** - Core logic, mocked dependencies, fast execution  
**Integration Tests** - Component interactions, database, API endpoints  
**E2E Tests** - Full agent lifecycle, multi-agent scenarios, protocol compliance  
**Property-Based** - Hypothesis for edge cases and fuzz testing

## Tools & CI

**Testing Stack:** pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, hypothesis  
**CI/CD:** Automated runs on every PR, coverage reports, block merges if coverage drops

## Status

📋 **Planned** - Systematically adding tests module by module

## What's Next

- **Contribute** - Write tests for your PRs
- **Report** - Share untested edge cases on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3w5zuYUuwt)
