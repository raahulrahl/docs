# Increase Test Coverage to 80%

## Overview

Expanding test coverage across the entire Bindu codebase to ensure reliability, catch bugs early, and enable confident refactoring.

## Why 80% Coverage?

- **Reliability** - Catch bugs before they reach production
- **Confidence** - Refactor and improve code safely
- **Documentation** - Tests serve as usage examples
- **Regression Prevention** - Ensure fixes stay fixed
- **Quality Assurance** - Maintain high code quality standards

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual function and class testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- High coverage of core logic

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Database operations
- API endpoints
- Message handling

### End-to-End Tests
- Full agent lifecycle testing
- Multi-agent scenarios
- Protocol compliance
- Real-world workflows

### Property-Based Tests
- Hypothesis for edge case discovery
- Fuzz testing for robustness
- Invariant checking

## Coverage Goals by Module

| Module | Current | Target | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Core Protocol | 65% | 85% | High |
| Agent Runtime | 55% | 80% | High |
| Security | 70% | 90% | Critical |
| Skills | 45% | 75% | Medium |
| Extensions | 40% | 75% | Medium |
| UI/CLI | 30% | 70% | Low |

## Testing Tools

- **pytest** - Test framework
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio** - Async test support
- **hypothesis** - Property-based testing
- **faker** - Test data generation
- **freezegun** - Time mocking
- **responses** - HTTP mocking

## Test Types

### Functional Tests
```python
def test_agent_creates_task():
    agent = Agent(name="test")
    task = agent.create_task(description="Test task")
    assert task.status == TaskStatus.CREATED
```

### Edge Cases
```python
@given(st.text(), st.integers())
def test_message_with_random_data(content, value):
    # Property-based testing
    message = Message(content=content, metadata={"value": value})
    assert message.validate()
```

### Performance Tests
```python
def test_handles_1000_concurrent_tasks():
    # Load testing
    tasks = [agent.process_task(t) for t in range(1000)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    assert all(r.success for r in results)
```

## Continuous Integration

- Automated test runs on every PR
- Coverage reports in PR comments
- Block merges if coverage decreases
- Nightly full test suite runs
- Performance regression detection

## Documentation

- Test examples in docs
- Testing best practices guide
- How to write good tests
- Mocking strategies
- Debugging failed tests

## Status

ðŸš€ **In Progress** - Systematically adding tests module by module

## Timeline

- **Q1 2025** - Core protocol and security to 80%+
- **Q2 2025** - Agent runtime and skills to 75%+
- **Q2 2025** - Overall codebase to 80%
