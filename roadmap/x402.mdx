title: 'X402 Protocol Support'
---

## Overview

**The Problem:** How do agents pay for API calls, compute resources, or data access automatically? Traditional payment systems require human intervention.

**The Solution:** X402 protocol - Machine-to-machine micropayments using HTTP 402 Payment Required status code.

## How It Works

```
1. Agent calls API → 402 Payment Required (costs 100 credits)
2. Agent pays automatically via crypto wallet
3. Agent retries with payment proof → 200 OK + Data
```

**Benefits:** Pay-per-use, instant settlement, no human intervention

## Current Support
