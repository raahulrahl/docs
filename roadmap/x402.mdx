## What is This?

Imagine your AI agent needs to use a paid API. How does it pay automatically without you clicking "Buy Now" every time?

**That's X402!** It lets AI agents pay for things automatically using crypto.

## Simple Analogy

**Human World:**
- You want coffee ☕
- Barista says "$5 please"
- You pay with card 💳
- You get coffee ✅

**Agent World (X402):**
- Agent wants data 📊
- API says "100 credits please"
- Agent pays automatically with crypto 💰
- Agent gets data ✅

## How It Works (Step by Step)

```
1. Your agent asks API for data
   ↓
2. API responds: "That costs 100 credits"
   ↓
3. Agent automatically sends 100 credits (crypto)
   ↓
4. API confirms payment received
   ↓
5. API sends the data
   ↓
6. Done! All automatic, no human needed ✅
```

## Why This is Cool

**Without X402:**
- Agent needs data ❌
- Stops and waits for you ❌
- You manually pay ❌
- Agent continues ❌
- Slow and annoying ❌

**With X402:**
- Agent needs data ✅
- Agent pays automatically ✅
- Agent gets data ✅
- All happens in seconds ✅
- You never even notice ✅

- Weather API charges $0.01 per request
- Agent automatically pays and gets data
- You're charged at end of month

**Example 2: AI Services**
- Your agent needs image recognition
- Image API charges $0.05 per image
- Agent pays automatically for each image
- No subscription needed, pay only for what you use

**Example 3: Data Storage**
- Your agent needs to store files
- Storage costs $0.001 per MB per day
- Agent pays automatically as it stores
- Stop storing = stop paying

**Example 4: Premium Data**
- Your agent needs stock market data
- Data feed charges $0.10 per update
- Agent pays for each update it receives
- Real-time payments for real-time data


## What's Coming Next

- Perfect for tiny amounts (fractions of a cent)
- Instant confirmation

**More Networks:**
- Optimism (another fast, cheap network)
