title: 'Sentry Error Tracking'
---

## Overview

Production agents need robust error tracking. When your agent fails, you need to know which task caused it, what the user was doing, and whether it's affecting others.

Sentry provides this visibility with real-time alerts, error grouping, and detailed stack traces.

## What You Get

**Error Monitoring** - Automatic exception capture with agent context (task ID, user DID, context ID)  
**Performance Tracking** - Monitor slow operations, database queries, and API calls  
**Alerting** - Slack, Discord, email integration with configurable rules

## Integration Points

Sentry will monitor:
- Agent execution errors and task failures
- A2A protocol message processing
- Database queries and external API calls
- Background task execution

## Configuration

```python
import sentry_sdk
from bindu.observability import configure_sentry

# Initialize Sentry with Bindu
configure_sentry(
    dsn="your-sentry-dsn",
    environment="production",
    traces_sample_rate=0.1,
    profiles_sample_rate=0.1,
)
```

## Privacy & Security

Automatic scrubbing of API keys, passwords, and PII. GDPR-compliant with custom sanitization rules.
