# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about Bindu, the protocol, and agent development.

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Bindu?" icon="circle-question">
    Bindu is a framework that transforms your AI agent into an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and AP2 (Agent Protocol 2) compliant living server. It enables agents to communicate seamlessly with other agents and microservices across the open web using standardized protocols.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are A2A and AP2 protocols?" icon="network-wired">
    **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** is a protocol for agent communication, defining how agents discover, authenticate, and exchange messages.
    
    **AP2 (Agent Protocol 2)** extends A2A with commerce capabilities, enabling agents to negotiate, transact, and trade services.
    
    Bindu implements both protocols, making your agents compatible with the broader agent ecosystem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why use Bindu instead of building from scratch?" icon="lightbulb">
    Bindu eliminates the complexity of implementing A2A and AP2 protocols manually. Instead of writing hundreds of lines of protocol code, you simply use the `@pebblify` decorator and Bindu handles:
    
    - Protocol compliance
    - Message serialization
    - Task management
    - Context handling
    - Security and authentication
    - Error handling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Bindu free and open source?" icon="code">
    Yes! Bindu is open source under the MIT license. You can use it freely in personal and commercial projects.

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install Bindu?" icon="download">
    Install Bindu using pip or uv:
    
    ```bash
    # Using pip
    pip install bindu
    
    # Using uv (recommended)
    uv add bindu
    ```
    
    See the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) for complete setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the prerequisites?" icon="list-check">
    - Python 3.12 or higher
    - An AI framework (Agno, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
    - API keys for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    - Basic understanding of Python and async programming
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Bindu with my existing agent code?" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Yes! Bindu is designed to wrap existing agent implementations. Simply add the `@pebblify` decorator to your agent function:
    
    ```python
    @pebblify(
        author="Your Name",
        name="My Agent",
        description="My existing agent"
    )
    def my_existing_agent(messages: list[str]) -> str:
        # Your existing agent code
        return response
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know the A2A/AP2 protocols to use Bindu?" icon="book">
    No! Bindu abstracts away the protocol complexity. You can build agents without deep protocol knowledge. However, understanding the protocols helps you leverage advanced features.
    
    Check out our [Protocol Documentation](/protocol) to learn more.

    def my_agent(messages: list[str]) -> str:
        try:
            return process_messages(messages)
        except ValueError as e:
            raise InvalidParamsError(f"Invalid input: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            raise InternalError(f"Processing failed: {e}")
    ```
    
    Errors are automatically formatted as JSON-RPC error responses.

    Create multiple agents and coordinate them:
    
    ```python
    # Agent 1
    @pebblify(name="Research Agent")
    def research_agent(query: str) -> dict:
        # Research implementation
        pass
    
    # Agent 2
    @pebblify(name="Analysis Agent")
    def analysis_agent(data: dict) -> dict:
        # Analysis implementation
        pass
    
    # Orchestrator
    async def orchestrate(query: str):
        research = await research_agent(query)
        analysis = await analysis_agent(research)
        return analysis
    ```
    
    See [Multi-Agent Systems](/introduction/multi-agent-systems) for patterns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do agents share context?" icon="share-nodes">
    Use context IDs to maintain conversation continuity:
    
    ```python
    context_id = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440027"
    
    # Agent 1 creates task
    task1 = agent1.send_message(context_id=context_id)
    
    # Agent 2 references task 1
    task2 = agent2.send_message(
        context_id=context_id,
        reference_task_ids=[task1.id]
    )
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can agents negotiate with each other?" icon="handshake">
    Yes! Bindu supports the negotiation protocol:
    
    - Agents submit bids for tasks
    - Orchestrators evaluate proposals
    - Winning agents execute tasks
    - Losers are notified
    
    This enables market-based task allocation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance & Scaling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many requests can a Bindu agent handle?" icon="gauge-high">
    Performance depends on:
    
    - Your agent's complexity
    - LLM provider rate limits
    - Server resources
    - Concurrent request handling
    
    Typical agents handle 10-100 requests/second. Use load balancing and horizontal scaling for higher throughput.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I optimize agent performance?" icon="bolt">
    - **Cache responses**: Store common queries
    - **Batch requests**: Process multiple messages together
    - **Use faster models**: GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 for simple tasks
    - **Optimize prompts**: Reduce token usage
    - **Async processing**: Use async/await for I/O operations
    - **Connection pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I run multiple agents on one server?" icon="server">
    Yes! Run multiple agents on different ports:
    
    ```python
    # Agent 1 on port 8030
    @pebblify(
        name="Agent 1",
        deployment_config=DeploymentConfig(url="http://localhost:8030")
    )
    
    # Agent 2 on port 8031
    @pebblify(
        name="Agent 2",
