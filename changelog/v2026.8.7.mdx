## Migration Notes

### For users upgrading from previous versions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update dependencies">
    If upgrading from versions with exact dependency pins:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Schema name handling">
    Schema names now correctly truncate to 63 characters (PostgreSQL limit). No action needed - this is handled automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify configuration">
    Ensure your agent configuration includes the required `author` field:
    ```python
    config = {
        "author": "your.email@example.com",  # Required
        "name": "my_agent",
        # ... other config
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
